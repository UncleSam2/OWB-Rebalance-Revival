LIBERTY_BUCHANAN_DESC: "Liberty Buchanan was the daughter of a Colorado Warlord, who witnessed the harshness of the wasteland first hand as a young child. These experiences changed her, making her more brutalist in nature and cruel, yet it was not without purpose. She saw her father as weak and short sighted, with a coup attempted against him at the age of 20. It's failure drove her out to the people of the Iron Alliance, where she made a name for herself as a brutally efficient commander. One day she intends to make an empire for herself, and if she ever does she won't let it die without one hell of a fight."

COMMANDER_BOOMER_DESC: "Commander Boomer is the brightest member of the Boomerclave, with him even coming up with the name! No force in the wasteland will be able to match the power of the Boomerclave!"

ATHENA_DESC: "Athena is the daughter of the last tribal leader, Hera. Hera was killed by the Washington Brotherhood in the initial attacks on her people, and now with them out of the picture, Athena has retaken her place in the tribe as it's new leader. She hopes now to bring her tribe forward, possibly shaking the notion of being a tribe at all."
